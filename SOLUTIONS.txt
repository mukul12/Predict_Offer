Hypothesis:

Firstly, using the events_data json file, we have logs of each and every move the user has done.
eg: if he has clicked on a offer, if he viewed the offer etc. 
Hence we now know what sort of offers the user likes/ or the user is intrigued/attracted by.
Hence we could recommend offers which are quite similar to those offers the user has suggested.(based on his previous events)

This can be done by recommending him K- offers which are closer or related to the offers he himself has used previously!
This helps us to give the user a personal touch!

Other thing we could do is recommend the most popular offer that Vito app is currently offering,
Popularity can be found out by no. of time anyone has ever clicked on any offer. Maximum of those are the most popular items.

The implementation is done using GraphLab python.
You can find the following python notebook attached with the output along with the data provided by you!
Open the Internship Assignment.ipynb
